- Create your own inheritance chain for modelling various types of farm animals. 
- Use Class diagrams and TDD to test all classes apart of the abstract ones.
- Task: You will create 3 classes: FarmAnimal, Sheep and Horse. 
  - Animals will make noises and be able to introduce themselves.
    - your base class should be abstract and called FarmAnimal.
    - FarmAnimal should have the following:
      - a species,
      - a getter for the species
      - a introduceYourself() method which returns the same String like 'Hi, I am a cow'.
      - an abstract method called makeANoise which returns a String. This method is abstract, because there is no ‘default’ sound that an animal makes.
      create a subclass of FarmAnimal: Sheep.
      - Sheep should also have
        - in constructor, make species ‘sheep’
        - an implementation of the makeANoise which returns an appropriate String (eg. baa)
        - override of introduceYourself returning 'Hi, I am a sheep, baa baa'. Note that species and noise should come from variable.
      - create another subclass of FarmAnimal called Horse.
      - Horse should have the following:
        - in constructor, make species ‘horse’
        - a breed e.g. pony
        - a getter for the breed
        - an implementation of the makeANoise which returns an appropriate String (eg. neigh)
        - override of introduceYourself returning 'Hi, I am a horse from pony family, neigh neigh'. Note that species, noise and breed should come from variable.
